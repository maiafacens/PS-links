                        <span>
                            Our team is dedicated to creating a learning and collaborative environment where students interested in robotics and AI can not only expand their theoretical knowledge, but also put it into practice by carrying out concrete projects. We believe that practical application plays a key role in developing solid AI and engineering skills.

                        <span>
                            We offer challenges where participants can get involved in projects that address real-world challenges, allowing them to apply AI algorithms, data analysis and machine learning techniques to everyday situations. This not only enriches the learning experience, but also prepares our members to face the challenges of industry and AI research with confidence.
